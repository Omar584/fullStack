                A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History 
                is a 1978 book by the American author Michael H. Hart. Published 
                by his father's publishing house, it was his first book and was 
                reprinted in 1992 with revisions. It is a ranking of the 100 people 
                who, according to Hart, most influenced human history. 
                Unlike various other rankings at the time, Hart was not attempting to 
                rank on "greatness" as a criterion, but rather whose actions 
                most changed the course of human history.
