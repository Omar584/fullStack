            <div class = "description">Rich Dad Poor Dad is a financial self-help 
                book written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. 
                The book tells the story of a boy with two fathers, 
                one rich and one poor, to help readers develop the mindset 
                and financial knowledge needed to build 
                a life of wealth and freedom. 
                The titular "rich dad" is Kiyosaki's best friend's father who 
                accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, 
                while the "poor dad" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own 
                father who worked hard all his life 
                but never obtained financial security
