                Mein Kampf ('My Struggle') is a 1925
                autobiographical manifesto by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler.
                The work describes the process by which Hitler became 
                antisemitic and outlines his political ideology and 
                future plans for Germany. Volume 1 of Mein Kampf was published
                in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926. The book was edited first 
                by Emil Maurice, then by Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.
