                The book has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms
                courses at many universities and is commonly cited as a reference 
                for algorithms in published papers, with over 10,000 citations
                documented on CiteSeerX and over 67,000 citation on
                Google Scholar as of 2023.The book sold half a million
                copies during its first 20 years, and surpassed a 
                million copies sold in 2022. Its fame has led to the 
                common use of the abbreviation "CLRS" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein),
                or, in the first edition, "CLR" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest).
