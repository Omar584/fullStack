                "The Alchemist" follows Santiago,
                a young shepherd who embarks on a journey to
                find a hidden treasure near the Egyptian pyramids
                after having a recurring dream. Along the way,
                he encounters various characters who impart wisdom
                about life and destiny. Through his journey, Santiago
                learns to follow his dreams and listen to the
                language of the world. Set against the backdrop of
                the desert, the novel explores themes of self-discovery, 
                perseverance, and the pursuit of one's dreams.
