            <strong>Philosophical study </strong>
            <div class = "description">
                The book examines the creative excitement 
                experienced by artists, scientists, and exceptional individuals.
                Csikszentmihalyi interviewed over 90 people 
                who have transformed their fields, 
                exploring how creativity shapes their lives.
                He challenges the myth of the “tortured genius” and 
                emphasizes the need to cultivate creativity not only in arts 
                and sciences but also in business, government, and education.
                By studying the lives of these exceptional individuals,
                Csikszentmihalyi shows us how we can enhance our everyday lives 
                through creativity
