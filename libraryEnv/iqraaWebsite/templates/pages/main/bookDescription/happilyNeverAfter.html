                Two love sceptics agree to work together as 
                professional wedding disruptors. But fate has more romantic 
                plans in mind for them . . .
                When Sophie finds out right before getting married that she’s 
                been cheated on (again!) it’s time for drastic action. Instead 
                of calling the wedding off, she hires a gorgeous stranger – Max – 
                to interrupt the ceremony and confront her fiancé. It’s hardly the 
                wedding she’d planned. But Sophie enjoys taking revenge. So, when Max
                asks if she’ll work with him to help others expose their cheating 
                partners, Sophie agrees. When they’re hired by a man who’s marrying
                the girl that once broke Max’s heart, Sophie expects Max to revel 
                in the job. But instead, he seems to be wrestling with his feelings
                for his ex. And worse than that, Sophie is jealous
