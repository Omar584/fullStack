            <strong>Tragedy</strong>
            <div class = "description">
                King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare.
                It is loosely based on the mythological Leir of Britain.
                King Lear, in preparation for his old age,
                divides his power and land between his daughters 
                Goneril and Regan, who pay homage to gain favour, 
                feigning love. The King's third daughter, Cordelia, 
                is offered a third of his kingdom also, but refuses to 
                be insincere in her praise and affection.
                [1] She instead offers the respect of a daughter and 
                is disowned by Lear who seeks flattery.
                Regan and Goneril subsequently 
                break promises to host Lear and his entourage,
                so he opts to become homeless and destitute, 
                goes insane, and the French King married to 
                Cordelia invades Britain to restore order and Lear's rule.
                In a subplot, Edmund, the illegitimate son of Gloucester,
                betrays his brother and father. Tragically, Lear, 
                Cordelia and several other main characters die
