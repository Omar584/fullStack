A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History 
is a 1978 book by the American author Michael H. Hart. Published 
by his father's publishing house, it was his first book and was 
reprinted in 1992 with revisions. It is a ranking of the 100 people 
who, according to Hart, most influenced human history. 
Unlike various other rankings at the time, Hart was not attempting to 
rank on "greatness" as a criterion, but rather whose actions 
most changed the course of human history.
