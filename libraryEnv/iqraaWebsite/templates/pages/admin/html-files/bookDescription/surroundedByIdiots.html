Author Thomas Erikson explains that there 
are four key behavior types that define how we 
interact with and perceive the people around us. 
Understanding someone’s pattern of behavior is the 
key to successful communication. Erikson breaks down 
the four kinds of behavior types—Reds who are dominant 
and commanding, Yellows who are social and optimistic, 
Greens who are laid back and friendly, and Blues who 
are analytical and precise—and explains how to identify 
and interact with each type of person. Instead of 
being bogged down with overly technical categorizations, 
the simple four color system allows you to speedily 
identify a friend or coworker and adjust how you speak and share with them.
