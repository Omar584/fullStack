                Author Thomas Erikson explains that there 
                are four key behavior types that define how we 
                interact with and perceive the people around us. 
                Understanding someone’s pattern of behavior is the 
                key to successful communication. Erikson breaks down 
                the four kinds of behavior types—Reds who are dominant 
                and commanding, Yellows who are social and optimistic, 
                Greens who are laid back and friendly, and Blues who 
                are analytical and precise—and explains how to identify 
                and interact with each type of person. Instead of 
                being bogged down with overly technical categorizations, 
                the simple four color system allows you to speedily 
                identify a friend or coworker and adjust how you speak and share with them.
